  <h1>Mozilla Badge Backpack Terms of Use</h1>
  <h3>April 4, 2012</h3>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Mozilla Corporation (<dfn id="mozilla">Mozilla</dfn>, <dfn id="us">us</dfn> or <dfn id="we">we</dfn>) is committed to promoting choice and innovation on the web.  That’s why Mozilla created the Open Badges Infrastructure (<dfn id="obi">OBI</dfn>). OBI makes it easy to issue, earn and display <dfn id="badges">badges</dfn>, which are digital symbols of recognition. The OBI is defined by two aspects: (i) the <dfn id="spec">Open Badge Specification</dfn>, which technically describes the Open Badge standard and (ii) a <dfn id="backpack">Badge Backpack</dfn>, which is a service that provides badge earners a way to collect and manage badges. The <a class="onpage">Badge Backpack</a> is a repository for collecting and displaying badges from a variety of sources and is a user management interface where you can collect, delete, group badges and more. To learn more about OBI, <a href="http://openbadges.org/legal_faq.html">click here</a>. Mozilla hosts its own Badge Backpack called the <dfn id="mozbackpack">Mozilla Badge Backpack</dfn>.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Your use of the <a class="onpage">Mozilla Badge Backpack</a> is subject to these Terms of Use as well as the related policies referred to in these Terms of Use (we will refer to these collectively as the <dfn id="terms">Terms</dfn>). For clarity, your use of the <a class="onpage">Open Badge Specification</a> is subject to separate terms. Also, other Badge backpacks may be subject to other terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This section is a summary of the terms below. It is provided as an aid to your understanding—but be sure to read the entire document, because when you use the Mozilla Badge Backpack, you are indicating you agree and accept our whole Terms of Use, not just this summary:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are under 18, you may use the Mozilla Badge Backpack, but you have to get the consent and supervision of your parent or legal guardian. Regardless, you have to be at least 13 years old to use the Mozilla Badge Backpack.</li>
    <li>If you are an issuer and if you would like to allow your earners to send a badge, you’ve got to comply with our <a href="#issuerguide">issuer guidelines</a>.</li>
    <li>Our use of your information will be in accordance with the Mozilla Badge Backpack <a href="/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>.</li>
    <li>Issuers (not Mozilla) are solely responsible for the badges they send us. </li>
    <li>Don’t do anything illegal or that could hurt us or others.</li>
    <li>We’re not responsible for your use of the Mozilla Badge Backpack or the actions of other users, including Issuers or other third parties in the OBI ecosystem.</li>
    <li>You’ll be responsible for your use or misuse of the Mozilla Badge Backpack.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Some More Definitions</h2>
  <p>
    An <dfn id="issuer">Issuer</dfn> is a person or entity that issues or awards badges,  which earners can then send from the issuer to their Mozilla Badge Backpack. Most badges are issued by third parties but, in some cases, Mozilla issues badges. 
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn id="earner">Earner</dfn> is anyone that earns a Badge and uses the OBI Backpack.
  </p>

  <h2>Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must be over 13 to use the Mozilla Badge Backpack. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, by using the Mozilla Badge Backpack, you agree that: (i) you are at least 18 years old or are acting with the consent and supervision of your parent; and (ii) you have full power, capacity, and authority to accept these Terms on behalf of yourself, or if applicable, your employer or other entity that you represent. 
  </p>

  <h2>Modifications to the Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to change these Terms in our sole discretion. By your continued use of the site you agree to be bound by future revisions.  If we do make changes, we may notify you through email or on the Mozilla Badge Backpack but it is your responsibility to periodically visit the “Terms of Use” page on the site to learn about and review the most current version of the these Terms. If you have any questions about these Terms, please <a href="mailto:openbadges@mozilla.org">contact us</a>. 
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    By using the Mozilla Badge Backpack you agree to the information handling practices in our Mozilla Badge Backpack <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Badge Content</h2>
  <p>
    Issuers are solely responsible for the information and content contained in your badge, including the accuracy and integrity of such information.  Mozilla is not responsible for and makes no representation or warranty about the accuracy or integrity of that information. 
  </p>

  <h2>Your Badges and Submissions</h2>
  <p>
    As an Earner, you may upload comments, profile pictures, push badges and other content as a part of the features of the Mozilla Badge Backpack (<dfn id="submissions">Your Submissions</dfn>). By uploading Your Submissions, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use Your Submissions in connection with the provision of the Mozilla Badge Backpack. For clarity, Your Submissions include any information or content you may upload in relation to your badges. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You represent and warrant that Your Submissions and any content you provide in a badge will not infringe the rights of any third party and that you will comply with our <a href="#contentguide">Content Guidelines</a>. 
  </p>

  <section id="issuerguide">
    <h2>Issuer Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      As an Issuer, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use badges (including all the content and code in them) pushed to us by Earners from you in connection with the Mozilla Badge Backpack. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are an Issuer of badges and enable earners to send badges to their Mozilla Badge Backpack, you also represent and warrant to us that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>You will comply with all laws and regulations, including having a legally compliant privacy policy describing your role and interaction with the Mozilla Badge Backpack as well as your collection, use, retention or disclosure of information used in badges.</li>
      <li>Your badges will comply with our <a href="#contentguide">Content Guidelines</a>.</li>
      <li>You will comply with the applicable guidelines in the <a href="http://openbadges.org/legal_faq.html">Open Badges FAQ</a> for Issuers.</li>
      <li>You will get Earner consent prior to sending a Badge to the Mozilla Badge Backpack.</li>
      <li>You will not send us the information of any user under the age of 13. </li>
      <li>None of your badges will contain content or other information that infringes the rights of any third party (including intellectual property, privacy or publicity rights).</li>
      <li>Badges may only contain the user’s email address, the issuer’s name, the badge name and specific data about what the badge means such as the badge description and criteria URL, which is a URL pointing to a page hosted by the issuer that details all the criteria required for earning the badge. You will minimize any <a href="/privacy.html#personalinfo">personal information</a> inserted into a badge’s description by limiting that information to the achievement or accomplishment of skills, attainment of certification or credentials.  See the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Assertions">technical specifications</a> about badges for more information. </li>
      <li>If you are an educational institution, the criteria for earning badges may list required grades or minimum grades but the badge itself may not contain any information indicating the actual grade received by that Earner.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and believe that content available by means of one of Mozilla’s websites infringes one or more of your copyrights, please immediately notify Mozilla's Copyright Agent by means of emailed, mailed, or faxed notice (<dfn id="dmca">DMCA Notice</dfn>) and include the information described below. You can review 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for authoritative detail, or consult your own attorney if you need assistance. If Mozilla takes action in response to a DMCA Notice, it will make a good faith attempt to contact the party that made such content available by means of the most recent email address, if any, provided by such party to Mozilla. You may be held liable for damages based on certain material misrepresentations contained in a DMCA Notice. Thus, if you are not sure content located on or linked to by the website infringes your copyright, you should consider first contacting an attorney.
  </p>
  <p>
    All DMCA Notices should include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A signature, electronic or physical, of the owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive copyright right that is being infringed;</li>
    <li>An identification of the copyrighted work or works that you claim have been infringed;</li>
    <li>A description of the nature and location of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit Mozilla to find and positively identify that content, including the URL where it is located;</li>
    <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address where we can contact you; and</li>
    <li>A statement by you: (i) that you believe in good faith that the use of the material that you claim infringes your copyright is not authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner's agent; and, (ii) that all of the information contained in your DMCA Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of, or a person authorized to act on behalf an owner of, the exclusive copyright right that is being infringed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mozilla's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is as follows:
  </p>
  <div id="hcard-Harvey-Anderson" class="vcard">
    <span class="fn">Harvey Anderson</span>
    <div class="org">Mozilla Corporation</div>
    <div class="adr">
      <div class="street-address">650 Castro Street, Suite 300</div>
      <span class="locality">Mountain View</span>, 
      <span class="region">CA</span> 
      <span class="postal-code">94041</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      Email: <span class="email">dmcanotice at mozilla dot com </span>
    </div>
    <div class="tel">
      <span class="type">Phone Number:</span> 650-903-0800
    </div>
    <div class="tel">
      <span class="type">Fax:</span> 650-903-0875
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of a DMCA notice, Mozilla may not act upon your notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mozilla will terminate a user's account if, under appropriate circumstances, they are determined to be a repeat infringer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The contact information provided above also applies to notices that are based on non-U.S. copyrights or trademarks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only DMCA Notices, Trademark Notices (which are defined below), and international copyright or trademark notices should go to the copyright agent. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Please be advised that any DMCA Notices sent to Mozilla may be sent to third parties (including the accused) and posted on the Internet (including at <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">http://www.chillingeffects.org/</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>Trademark Notices</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a trademark owner or an agent of a trademark owner and believe that content available by means of one of Mozilla’s websites infringes one or more of your trademarks, please immediately notify Mozilla's Copyright Agent by means of emailed, mailed, or faxed notice (<dfn id="trademark">Trademark Notice</dfn>) and include the information described above for DMCA notices. Mozilla handles notices it receives of trademark violations via a process very similar to the DMCA Notice process that is described above for copyrights. In addition to the DMCA Notice requirements, Mozilla requires that the entire Trademark Notice be made by the trademark owner (or her agent) under penalty of perjury.
  </p>

  <h2>Representation and Warranty</h2>
  <p>
    You represent and warrant that your use of the Mozilla Badge Backpack will be in accordance with these Terms, with any applicable laws and regulations, and with any other applicable policy or terms and conditions. You further represent and warrant that you will not circumvent the encryption or other security measures put in place by Mozilla with respect to the Mozilla Badge Backpack.
  </p>

  <h2>Release and Indemnification</h2>
  <p>
    You release Mozilla, its officers, employees, agents and successors from claims, demands and damages of every kind or nature arising out of or related to any disputes with other users, including Issuers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its contractors and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Mozilla Badge Backpack, including but not limited to those arising out of your violation of any representation or warranty contained in these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Termination or Suspension of Access or Use</h2>
  <p>
    <b>By User.</b> You may terminate your use of the Mozilla Badge Backpack by deleting your account by following the directions on <a href="/privacy.html#deletion">this page</a>.  Your backpack will be deleted from Mozilla’s systems.  This will not delete badges from your issuer’s service or other backpacks or third parties–please contact those entities if you would like them to remove or delete your badges or accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>By Mozilla.</b> Mozilla has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Mozilla’s sole discretion, remove any content or any user account that, in Mozilla’s reasonable opinion, violates any Mozilla policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Mozilla may at any time suspend or terminate your use of the Mozilla Badge Backpack if Mozilla is no longer going to provide the Mozilla Badge Backpack or Mozilla believes you have violated any policies or breached these Terms.
